What is std::array?

Is a container
- in general programming, it's an object that can hold other objects
- in C++, only class types in Containers library is considered a container.

Is an aggregate
Array or class with:
- No user-declared constructors
- No private or protected non-static data members
- no base clasees
- no virtual functions

Encapsulates fixed size arrays
- 

Why?
- More efficient in small arrays (?)
- We can use constexpr in larger context (?). constexpr basically means it can be computed during compile time. We don't need to do it during runtime. Means it's faster to execute!
